title: Disable UAC Secure Desktop
description: Disables switching to the Secure Desktop when prompting for elevation. An application would need admin privileges to control the mouse and keyboard to accept the UAC prompt anyways. As a note, UAC is not designed to save you from malware, UAC can easily be bypassed on admin accounts (e.g. check GitHub)
