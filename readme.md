# 🤔 Why Suckless Windows?
## 🚀 Optimize Performance
Suckless Windows attempts to speed up the system, by eliminating redundant tasks and services running in the background, without sacrificing on stability.

## 🔒 Enhance privacy and security
Suckless Windows removes the majority of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection.

Unlike most other Windows modifications, Suckless Windows doesn't remove any security features that most users need to maintain a secure system.
