# 🤔 Why Suckless Windows?
## 🚀 Optimize Performance
Suckless Windows attempts to speed up your system, by eliminating redundant tasks and services running in the background, without any sacrificing on stability.

## 🔒 Enhance privacy and security
Suckless Windows removes the majority of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection.

Unlike most other Windows modifications, Suckless Windows doesn't remove any security features that most users need to maintain a secure system.

## 😍 Increase usability
Suckless Windows applies some modifications to make Windows easier to use. This includes removing bloatware and unwanted apps, configuring the interface, disabling ads, telemetry and so on.

# 🔧 Installation
## Recommend version
- Windows 10 (1809 or higher)

## Some notes
- Dont care about the `Unverified playbook` pop-up, this playbook is safe & open-source. Paying money to get verified is unnecessary (and we don't have money :p).
- Before using, considering you already have a small understand how and what you need in your Windows machine, as the source code is public, please read what does it do, you can modify it to suit your needs.
- I'm not responsible for anything if this breaks your Windows machine, I RECOMMEND only use Suckless Windows after reinstalled stock Windows from Microsoft, NOT ANY 3RD PARTY WINDOWS!
