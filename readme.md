# 🤔 Why Suckless Windows
## 🚀 Optimize Performance
Suckless Windows attempts to speed up the system, by eliminating redundant tasks and services running in the background, without sacrificing on stability.

## 🔒 Enhance privacy and security

Unlike most other Windows modifications, Suckless Windows doesn't remove any security features that most users need to maintain a secure system.
